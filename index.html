          "The useful part"

            # Disclaimer
            
            Although trying to stick to facts, this is meant to be a light introductory presentation, 
            so no in depth (probably boring) explanations here.
            
            Words carry information. Meaning comes to the heads interpreting them.
            
            YMMV
            
            Most of the observations apply to other languages

            Useful part considering a specific target audience
            
            Useful part does not imply that the rest is useless

            ## Humans
            
            * Most of us believe to speak a single language even when already does multiple
              * Mother language, body language, social circle variations and so on
            * Tend to believe to be more human than others
          </section>
          <section data-markdown>
            ## Humans
            
            * Tend to attach feelings and flags even to inanimate objects and ideas, including programming languages
            * Are the reason to exist of many solutions but are sometimes forgotten by other humans who develop them
            * Maybe more on those topics in a future presentation

          ## What is Scala and why
          
          * Programming language created in 2004
          * Similar to many other programming languages
          * Can be used to [introduce children to programming](http://www.kogics.net/kojo)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## What can we do with it
          
          * Desktop applications
          * Mobile apps
          * Websites
          * Someday even play with  DNA
            * Actually there are libraries for that [now](https://github.com/bioscala/bioscala/blob/master/src/test/scala/bio/sequence/ntsequence_spec.scala)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## How to start using it
          
          * Googling around you will find scary stories about learning curves
          * Examples usually demonstrate very specific features
            * Most of the times ["Hello world"](http://www.scala-js-fiddle.com/gist/77a3840678d154257ca1/HelloWorld.scala) is too little 
            and ["Foo Bar"](http://www.scala-js-fiddle.com/gist/9443f8e0ecc68d1058ad/Oscilloscope.scala) is too much
          * Starting from something that is simple, meaningful and working helps a lot
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## What do we need
          
          * A computer with Internet connection
          * JDK
          * Some working piece of code
            * You can get one [here](https://github.com/oswaldo/react-scalajs-scalatags)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## How to make it work
          
          Start it
          
          ```shell
          activator
          ```
          
          ```shell
          [playserver] $ ~run
          ```
          
          After the required downloads are done, [see it in action](http://localhost:9000)
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## How do I change it
          
          Find the file AppRouter.scala and change line 32 to
          
          ```scala
          Menu("Item list", Items(Item.Info))
          ```
          
          Refresh the browser and see check how it looks
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          ## What's next
          
          You now have an up and running example of what can be done
          
          You can go on from here and continue down that line and use it as the start of a real thing or take a completely different path (a mobile app maybe)
          
          More presentations will be created for the different paths
          
          ### Stay tuned :)
